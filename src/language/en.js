          I'm Levy. I'm originally brazilian. I consider me as a calm person,
          friendly, curious and pretty dedicated. I like to travel, learn new
          things and to know new people.

          of Future Laboratory and GAUDI - Algorithms and Distributed Computing
          Group. The LIF is a group started at UESC and GAUDI at UFBA. Both
          involves students and teachers. Many of my projects and publications
          were developed with these groups.

          Most of my experiences are in Web Programming, IoT (Internet of
          Things), Ontology, Blockchain and other areas and technologies. IoT is
          like a passion for me. It is so fascinating the act of transforming
          something phisical, touchable, into something smart by simply adding
          an abstract feature, the code.

          The charts below demonstrate the programming languages that I have

          experience and knowledge I have in each of the languages. It is a

      "After I entered the Computer Science course, I realized that many people gave up immediately upon entering the course, as they believed that they would deal with subjects such as computer maintenance or the use of Excel, Word and other tools, and did not know what programming was. In 2017, more specifically in my 4th course's semester, when I already had a reasonable knowledge of the subjects, I decided to create Hellow Tips to publish programming tips, that way, people who want to be programmers understand the idea of programming and other technologies and concepts. Also those who are studying programming in a course and those who already are can improve their knowledge. Most of the posts are in Portuguese because I wanted to first attract my classmates and get feedback from them about the posts."
